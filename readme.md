Blogingme Backend
This is the backend for the Blogingme application, a robust and scalable blogging platform. It provides a RESTful API for managing user accounts, posts, comments, and subscriptions, serving as the core engine for all application data and logic.

Technology Stack
The backend is built with a modern and efficient stack:

Node.js & Express.js: The primary runtime and web framework for building the server.

MongoDB & Mongoose: A flexible NoSQL database for storing all application data, with Mongoose as the ODM for schema enforcement and data modeling.

Clerk: A comprehensive service for user authentication, providing secure and easy-to-implement sign-up, sign-in, and session management.

Render: The cloud platform used for continuous deployment and hosting of the API service.

Cors: Middleware that enables cross-origin requests, allowing the frontend to securely communicate with the API.

Core Features
User Management: Secure user registration, authentication, and session management handled by Clerk. User profiles include a customizable bio.

Draft Posts: Secure endpoints for creating and managing draft content before publishing.

Comments System: Users can add comments to blog posts, fostering community engagement.
